        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
          system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
          Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
          interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer
          Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application
          called a web browser, and are published by a software application called
          a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
          which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which
          technologies the Web is built.
